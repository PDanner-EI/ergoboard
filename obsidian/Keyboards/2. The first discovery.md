# Ergonomic keyboards

- split
	-> more natural shoulder and wrist rotation, because the keyboard halfs can be placed further apart and individually with additional space in between.
	
- angled rows and columns
	-> keys easier and more comfortably reachable by fingers
	
- added thumbkeys
	-> more functionality for a finger that is underused
