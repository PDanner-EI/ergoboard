# The idea

- [ ] Finally learn to properly touch type instead of hunt and peck or hybrid. [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typing)

-> Much faster typing since I no longer have to look between screen and keyboard
-> Faster programming and more focus on the actual function of the code instead of the correct formatting
-> Faster navigation between windows because I can now use the shortcuts efficiently
-> Shift my overall focus away from the keyboard and towards what I'm actually trying to do

# The problem

1. I learned touch typing back in school, but never actually used it after
2. I'm already used to my hybrid system with about 4-5 fingers (Probably a consequence of 3. and 4.)
3. Moving my pinky finger to 'shift' or 'ctrl' requires me to make awkward reaches and pulls my fingers from their home row.
4. Too many keys require me to move away from the home row, wasting time and requiring me to look at my keyboard anyway.
5. Touch typing for programming feels too unnatural and awkward, because I constantly have to reach for all the brackets and re-home
6. Numpad useful but inefficient for programming. Also too many back and forth re-homing
7. Some key/shifted key combinations on qwerty/qwertz just don't make sense to me. Why `"` not on `'`?    `!`/`?`   `&`/`|`   `/`/`\`

# The solution

1. Relearn
2. Unlearn / Try to avoid
3. Different key layout or different physical keyswitch layout
4. Less overall keys
5. Different key layout / layers
6. Different key layout / layers
7. Custom key layout
